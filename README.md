A personal income and expenditure tracker application developed using Flutter, Dart Language, and Hive Database is a mobile application that helps users keep track of their finances while leveraging the performance and speed of Hive Database.
The application should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Users should be able to easily add new income and expenses entries and view their financial data in a clear and concise manner. The application should also provide the ability to categorize income and expenses to help users identify areas where they may be overspending.
